## Running the Game

**Keep it moving:**
- If unsure, call for a roll
- Use "success, but" to say yes with complications
- Let players argue for bonuses — reward creativity

**Combat flow:**
- No initiative — go around table or by fiction
- Describe actions cinematically
- Use terror moves as consequences for failed player rolls

**Character flaws:**
- Invoke BUT clauses to create drama
- Don't overuse — once or twice per player per session feels right
- Players should want to invoke their own flaws for learning points

**One-shot pacing:**
- Start in the action or with a clear hook
- 2-3 encounters with roleplay between
- End with a clear climax (terror fight or major decision)
