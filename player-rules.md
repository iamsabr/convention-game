## Making Tests

Roll **2d6 + modifiers** for any action with uncertain outcome.

| Result | Outcome |
|--------|---------|
| 1-5 | Fail |
| 6-8 | Success, but... *(complication)* |
| 9-10 | Success |
| 11+ | Success, and... *(bonus)* |

**Snake eyes (1-1):** Always has a complication, no matter your bonus.
**Boxcars (6-6):** Always has a bonus, no matter your penalty.

**Add bonuses when relevant:**
- Stat bonus (+2 highest / -1 lowest)
- Background applies: +1
- Talent applies: +1
- Situational: ±1 (GM discretion)

**BUT Clause:** When your flaw applies, take -1 and gain 1 **learning point**. Spend learning points for rerolls.

## Movement & Range

| Band | Meaning | Example |
|------|---------|---------|
| **Here** | Same zone as you | The room you're in |
| **There** | One zone away | An adjacent room |
| **Far** | Two+ zones away | Requires multiple turns |

- Move anywhere within **Here** and still take an action
- Moving to **There** takes your entire turn (no action)
- **Melee** attacks can only hit targets **Here**
- **Ranged** attacks can hit **Here** or **There**, but not **Far**
